steps to create the world's best scouting app (in no particular order)

3d. search function on match summary

4. sync across multiple devices
    a. how will connecting to the internet at competitions work? cellular?

5. clean up appearances (css), neaten code if possible/necessary, resolve any errors/bugs

6. (maybe very last thing we consider) review code, season-specific variable names (i.e. speaker, amp scoring) and add appropriate notes to reskinning-instructions.md about how to change the code next year to adapt

8. should we consider exporting the data somehow to somewhere else? ie excel, sheets, etc. to archive data or to compile it all?
